# FastAPI service written in TDD
During this workshop, we will create a small service using FastAPI that will be responsible for maintaining a mapping of SKUs to products. This is part of a larger product that processes game sales data.

An SKU represents a single game/DLC that can be purchased (i.e. on Steam). In contrast, a product refers to a group of many SKUs related to each other (e.g., a game and all its DLCs).
